# MAE384ProjectFinal

The purpose of this group project is to prove our understanding of numerial methods when evaluating a real life situation where the methods would be useful in interpreting the data found. 

In section 1, we modeled the spread of infectious diseases using a SIR model.

In section 2, we used Newtons method of interpolation to estimate more data than was previously modeled, in section 1.

In section 3, we used a linear least square regression model to compare model-predicted data from seciton 2 to the true data set given in section 1, using various time frames.

In section 4, we modeled the transmission rate as a periodic wave and used a fast fourier transform to plot the spectrum of the infected cases.
